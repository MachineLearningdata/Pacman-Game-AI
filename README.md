# Pacman-Game-AI
An AI which learns to play pacman using Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques.

The game uses OpenAI Gym toolkit to provide simulation of Atari Game environment. Instead of getting a grid of pacman world or the images of screen , I try to train my bot using RAM states as input. 

I did this project because there has been very less effort on using RAM states as input for training Pacman agent.

## Dependencies 

* OpenAI Gym toolkit (https://github.com/openai/gym)
* Keras (https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
* Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/faq/installing_faq.html)
